# Welcome to libi2c

## General

*libi2c* is an open source helper library providing easy-to-use
functions for accessing I2C devices attached to Linux(tm) systems.

## Why make yet another I2C library?

Yes, there are plenty of libraries like this out there including
[libsoc](https://github.com/jackmitch/libsoc) which is very nice.
The reason for publishing this library is that it is smaller than
libsoc and, well, was already written so why not publish?

## You're using goto statements??  Eww...

See Section 7) of [Linux(tm) kernel's coding style](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst).
